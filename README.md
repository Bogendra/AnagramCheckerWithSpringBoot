# AnagramCheckerWithSpringBoot

A sample Springboot project to check if 2 given strings are anagrams or not.

I have added sample JUNIT testcases using Rest Template.

I have placed in plugin places for exception handling for the user to extend as needed.

Below is the sample GET request URL:

http://localhost:8080/anagrams?word1=cinema&word2=iceman
